# Shadow-CLJS vs sentry-cli sourcemap demo

This repo is a demonstration of an issue that prevents the use of shadow-cljs sourcemaps with sentry.
Running `sentry-cli sourcemaps inject` on sourcemaps generated by shadow-cljs results in error, that can be easily reproduced by runnint `npm run demo:example` in this repo:

```
$ npm run demo:example

> shadow-maps@0.0.1 demo:example
> sentry-cli sourcemaps inject dist-example

> Searching dist-example
> Found 2 files
> Analyzing 2 sources
> Analyzing completed in 0.001s
> Injecting debug ids
error: Invalid sourcemap at dist-example/demo.js.map

Caused by:
    encountered incompatible sourcemap format

Add --log-level=[info|debug] or export SENTRY_LOG_LEVEL=[info|debug] to see more output.
Please attach the full debug log to all bug reports.
```


You can also use `npm run build` and `npm run demo` to test play with different shadow-cljs settings or change the code in `src`
